'* MorphDisplay v1.00 - Ownerdrawn digital display user control.         *
'* Download by http://www.codefans.net
'* Written January, 2006, by Matthew R. Usner for Planet Source Code.    *
'*************************************************************************
'* MorphDisplay is a digital display control that uses techniques that I *
'* learned by studying LaVolpe's "Shaped Regions" submission (PSC, at    *
'* txtCodeId=58562).  Other open source LCD/LED display controls I have  *
'* found at PSC or other sites depend on basic drawing techniques like   *
'* "Line" or shuffle bitmaps of LEDs around to achieve their goal.  This *
'* control uses shaped regions to form hexagonal, trapezoidal or rect-   *
'* angular digit segments.  Control can be used for calculator displays, *
'* displaying time, or as a simple counter.  Just about every conceivable*
'* aspect of this control can be customized via a multitude of proper-   *
'* ties.  Main and exponent digits separately configurable.  Properties  *
'* for segment height and width, intersegment gap, and interdigit gap    *
'* allow you to size, position and space digits exactly the way you want.*
'* Support for thousands separator and decimal separator.  Thousands and *
'* decimal separators can be defined as a comma or period so that inter- *
'* national standards can be maintained.  Thousands grouping can also be *
'* adjusted according to international preference.  Background bitmap    *
'* can be tiled or stretched.  All colors are also fully user-definable. *
'* Negative numbers can be displayed in a different color than positive. *
'* Corners can be individually rounded for a different look.  A simulated*
'* digit burn-in display mode is also available if desired.  A Filament  *
'* option allows digits to be displayed as wireframed, rather than solid.*
'* The .ShowExponent property allows you to disable exponent display if  *
'* you wish to use this as a simple counter.  Six basic themes are incl- *
'* uded that show various display styles. Since there's ~40 properties   *
'* that make up one theme, it is a real good idea to make a theme out of *
'* a combination of properties that works in a particular application.   *
